## 📊 Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for the SCM Mining application. The system currently has a **solid foundation** with complete procurement workflows, approval systems, and inventory management.

**Major Update (January 2026):** We've made significant progress on Phase 1 priorities, delivering 4 major modules in one month:

### 🎉 Recent Achievements (January 2026)

1. ✅ **Warehouse Location Management UI** - Self-service location management (650% ROI)
2. ✅ **Item Inventory Settings** - Reorder point configuration system
3. ✅ **Inventory Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time KPIs with FIFO valuation
4. ✅ **Invoice Management System** - 3-way matching & payment tracking

**Impact:** 68+ hours of development completed, exceeding initial Phase 1 estimates. The system now has 90% warehouse module completion and 80% reporting module completion.

### Key Priorities (Updated)

1. **Notifications System** ⏳ - Keep users informed in real-time (Remaining)
2. **Advanced Analytics** ✅ - Provide management visibility (COMPLETE: Inventory)
3. **Integration Capabilities** ⏳ - Connect with external systems (Partial: Invoice)
4. **Warehouse Management** ✅ - Location UI & inventory settings (COMPLETE)
5. **Advanced Features** ⏳ - Forecasting, budgeting, quality control (Planned Phase 2)

### 1.4 Warehouse Location Management UI 📦 ✅ COMPLETE

**Effort Estimate:** 14-18 hours  
**Actual Effort:** ~16 hours  
**Business Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE (January 2026)**

#### ✅ Completed Implementation

**What Was Built:**

1. ✅ **Location Master Data CRUD**
    - Route: `/master-data/warehouse-locations`
    - List all locations with filters (warehouse, type, status)
    - Create/Edit/Delete operations
    - Search by code or name
    - Pagination support

2. ✅ **Location Details & Stock View**
    - Route: `/master-data/warehouse-locations/{id}`
    - Current stock summary (items, quantity, value)
    - Stock by item table with search
    - Recent movements (last 20 transactions)
    - Edit/Delete actions

3. ✅ **Frontend Pages**
    - `Index.vue` - List page with filters
    - `Form.vue` - Create/Edit form
    - `Show.vue` - Detail view with stock data

4. ✅ **Backend Enhancements**
    - Stock summary API endpoint
    - Recent movements API endpoint
    - Stock by item API endpoint
    - Full CRUD validation

5. ✅ **Navigation Integration**
    - Added to Master Data menu
    - Proper role-based access control

#### Previous Status (Before Completion)

**Effort Estimate:** 14-18 hours  
**Business Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### Current State

**✅ Backend Complete:**

- Database schema exists (`warehouse_locations` table)
- API endpoints functional (`WarehouseLocationController`)
- Model relationships working (`WarehouseLocation`, `Warehouse`)
- Business logic implemented (types: RECEIVING, STORAGE)
- Used internally by Put Away, Picking Order, Stock Reports

**❌ Frontend Missing:**

- No UI to manage warehouse locations
- No way to create/edit/delete locations
- No visibility into location hierarchy
- No location utilization dashboard
- Manual database entry required for new locations

**Impact:**
Users must ask developers to create new storage locations via database seeds. This is inefficient and blocks warehouse operations.

**3. Database Schema Enhancement**

Current schema is sufficient, but add these optional columns for Phase 2:

```sql
ALTER TABLE warehouse_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS capacity DECIMAL(15,2);
ALTER TABLE warehouse_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS max_weight DECIMAL(15,2);
ALTER TABLE warehouse_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE warehouse_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS floor_plan_coordinates JSONB;
```

**4. API Endpoints**
